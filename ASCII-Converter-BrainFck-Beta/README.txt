What is this?

A simple Brainfck program that takes a single character input (from digits 0-9, letters a-z, A-Z etc etc) and outputs the character along with its ASCII code in a neat X = 0YY format — all in pure Brainfck! 


Why did I make this?

I wanted to challenge myself to create something meaningful with love and caffeine (cuz why not💅🏻😄) before I turn 17 🎂 and i feel like i've not done enough in my 16 and it is giving me pressure in these months and still.

I made this within a day i learnt brainfck language. 

#note
this is beta version because cells are not managed well and there are some unused cells and questionable management. I'll try to make a clear version before i turn 17.

To the future me~
I love you so much even if you make questionable things~
